                    <h2>The Bolton Bling Privacy & Cookie Policy</h2>
                    <p>Bolton Bling are committed to complying with all relevant legislation on Data Protection and
                        have published this guide to help you understand how and why The Bradford Exchange collects
                        information from you, to whom such information is disclosed and what your rights are. If we
                        make changes to this Policy we will notify you by updating this statement on our website.
                        You can access our Website home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data.
                        However, when you register with The BB you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself. </p>
                    <h2>Information that we collect from every visitor to our website</h2>
                    <p>We collect anonymous cookie information about the site pages, items, stores and articles you view.
                        This is not used with personally identifiable information (such as the name and address you give
                        us when you place an order), but as aggregate information (group information) that helps us
                        learn more about how people use and react to our site, thereby helping us to create a more enriching
                        shopping experience for you. We store information about items you add to your cart so that your cart
                        selections are not lost between visits, but we will not know who placed the items
                        in the cart unless you log in or place an order. </p>

                    <h2>Collection and use of your personal information</h2>
                    <p>At The Bolton Bling, we endeavour to act fairly and honestly in all our customer transactions.
                        We keep complete and accurate records â€“ should you wish to do so then it is your right to request
                        information on the nature of the personal details we hold, how we collect it, how we use it and
                        how we disclose it. If you wish to access, correct or update your
                        personal information then simply contact us:</p><br>

                    <h2>Security of your personal information</h2>
                    <p>Protecting your personal privacy is our main concern. We take reasonable steps to ensure that all
                        information we collect, use or disclose is accurate. It is either stored or eventually destroyed
                        in a secured environment
                        accessed only by authorised personnel. </p>
                    <h2>Secure shopping</h2>
                    <p>We fully recognise the importance of secure shopping and the protection of your credit card details
                        when purchasing from us or from our affiliated companies online. Our web server uses proven technology
                        to encrypt your personal information, including debit or credit card numbers, names and addresses.
                        When you place an order, the encryption process converts the characters you enter into code that is
                        then securely transmitted over the Internet. This eradicates the potential accessibility of
                        your personal financial data by outside
                        individuals or agencies and all related fraud.</p><br>
