                    <p>Our policy is to abide strictly by all relevant current legislation
                        relating to consumer rights. Beyond this, we are also members of the
                        Direct Marketing Association and voluntarily subscribe to all of their
                        recommended best practice guidelines. A good place to find out about
                        consumer rights, especially when buying by mail order, is
                        by visiting the Citizen Advice Bureau website.</p>

                    <h2>Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>

                        time up to 14 days after the day you receive your order (except personalised items),
                      Bolton Bling operates a far more generous satisfaction guarantee than
                        most businesses. We want you to be completely happy with anything you buy from us.
                        For this reason, for most items we offer you the opportunity to return up to 365 days
                        after purchase and obtain a replacement or a full refund. The exceptions to the
                        365 day policy are: - jewellery, handbags and clothing items:
                        the satisfaction guarantee is limited to 120 days.</p>
